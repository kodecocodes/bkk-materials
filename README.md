# BOOK: Materials

> __TODO:__ Create a new repo from this template, create the requisite editions/x.x branch, add the book team with Write access, and update references in this readme as appropriate.


This repo contains all the downloadable materials and projects associated with the **[BOOK](https://www.kodeco.com/books)** from [kodeco.com](https://www.kodeco.com).

Each edition has its own branch, named `editions/[EDITION]`. The default branch for this repo is for the most recent edition.

## Forum

Weâ€™ve set up an official forum for the book at [https://forums.kodeco.com/c/books](https://forums.kodeco.com/c/books). This is a great place to ask questions about the book or to submit any errors you may find.
